# Whitelist/Blacklist rules
#
# Note that most of these get 'noautolearn'.  They should not be
# considered when deciding whether to auto-learn a message, as a
# user slip-up could result in scribbling side-effects in the bayes
# db as a result -- which is hard to remedy.

# 4.0 module rename, Bug 7826
